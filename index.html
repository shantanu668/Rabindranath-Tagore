     <P style= color:darkblue> <strong style="border: 2x solid red;"> BIOGRAPHICAL : </strong>Rabindranath Tagore (1861-1941) was the youngest son of Debendranath Tagore, a leader of the Brahmo Samaj, which was a new religious sect in nineteenth-century Bengal and which attempted a revival of the ultimate monistic basis of Hinduism as laid down in the Upanishads.
        He was educated at home; and although at seventeen he was sent to England for formal schooling, he did not finish his studies there.
         In his mature years, in addition to his many-sided literary activities, he managed the family estates, a project which brought him into close touch with common humanity and increased his interest in social reforms.
          He also started an experimental school at Shantiniketan where he tried his Upanishadic ideals of education.
           From time to time he participated in the Indian nationalist movement, though in his own non-sentimental and visionary way; and Gandhi, the political father of modern India, was his devoted friend. 
           Tagore was knighted by the ruling British Government in 1915, but within a few years he resigned the honour as a protest against British policies in India.</P>

       <h3> <strong>THE GREAT POET OF INDIA </strong> </h3>
     </center>
       <br>
       <p> <em style=color:blue;> Tagore had early success as a writer in his native Bengal. With his translations of some of his poems he became rapidly known in the West.
          In fact his fame attained a luminous height, taking him across continents on lecture tours and tours of friendship.
          For the world he became the voice of India’s spiritual heritage; and for India, especially for Bengal, he became a great living institution.</em>

        <p>Rabindranath Tagore Quotes</p>
      <blockquote style= "padding: 45px; color: rgb(42, 11, 116);"> <i> Who are you, reader, reading my poems a hundred years hence?
    I cannot send you one single flower from this wealth of the spring, one single streak of gold from yonder clouds.
    Open your doors and look abroad.
    From your blossoming garden gather fragrant memories of the vanished flowers of an hundred years before.
    In the joy of your heart may you feel the living joy that sang one spring morning, sending its glad voice across an hundred years.</i>
